# Smart Shoes and Stick for the Visually Impaired

## Project Overview
This project aims to empower visually impaired individuals with enhanced mobility and independence. By integrating cutting-edge technology into wearable devices, we offer an innovative solution to navigate the world safely. Utilizing Arduino UNO, Raspberry Pi, ultrasonic sensors, vibration motors, and potential AI integration, our system provides real-time feedback to detect and avoid obstacles.

## Features
- **Obstacle Detection**: Advanced ultrasonic sensors scan the environment to identify obstacles.
- **Tactile Feedback**: Shoes equipped with vibration motors alert users to obstacles in their path.
- **Auditory Assistance**: The smart stick provides voice feedback, offering guidance and alerting to nearby objects.
- **Technical Foundation**: Utilizes Arduino for real-time sensor data processing and Raspberry Pi for higher-level computations and future AI enhancements.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Arduino IDE for programming the Arduino UNO
- Raspbian OS installed on the Raspberry Pi

### Installation Guide
1. **Hardware Setup**: Follow the detailed schematics included in the repository to assemble the hardware components.
2. **Software Configuration**:
   - Install necessary libraries on the Arduino and Raspberry Pi.
   - Deploy the Arduino sketch to the Arduino UNO.
   - Set up the Raspberry Pi to process the sensor data and manage feedback mechanisms.
3. **System Activation**: Power up the system, and it's ready to use.

## How to Use
Simply turn on the system before navigating. It operates autonomously, providing vibrational feedback through the shoes and auditory signals via the stick when obstacles are detected.
